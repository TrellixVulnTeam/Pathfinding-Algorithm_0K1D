HOW TO OPEN FILE IN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK : 

1) INSTALL JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

The easiest way to get started 
with Jupyter Notebooks is by installing Anaconda.

1. Download the latest version of Anaconda for Python 3.
2. Install Anaconda by following the instruction on the download page.

or 

pip install jupyter

2) OPEN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
3) SELECT THE PROGRAM FILE named "ALGO PROJECT IN JUPYTER"


NOTE : We highly recommend to open the program file in jupyter,
because we use some data visualization which is better to perform in Jupyter because
it could show data visualization in same environment

IF YOU JUST WANT TO OPEN WITH THE PY FILE FORMAT, YOU CAN JUST RUN 
"ALGO PROJECT IN PY" IN ANY PYTHON CODE EDITOR
